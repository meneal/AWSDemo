I spent a lot of my time on EC2 instances for this project as that was what I was most 
interested in using AWS for.  I learned about the different ways you can actually instantiate
servers using AWS.  I was surprised to find that they had a separate service for creating "Spot Instances"
that are basically unused Amazon Capacity.  You can bid up to a specific amount per hour for the instances
but they aren't guaranteed to be there as long as you may expect.  As Amazon put it "Your Spot instance
Runs whenever your bid exceeds the current market price".  The idea is to use the spot instance for things 
that can tolerate loss of service for when the excess capacity is unavailble.
